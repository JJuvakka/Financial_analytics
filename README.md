# [Project 1: Tool for options trading to support decision making: Project overview](https://github.com/JJuvakka/Financial_analytics)
* Simulated S&P 500 prices and returns as a random walk with drift
* Calculated theoretical probability for profit and expected outcome for short vertical call spread
* Simulated different portfoliovalues for an optionsportfolio
* Calculated expected portfoliovalue, expected annual return and probabilities for the portfoliovalue to drop 50 % or 100 %.
* Plotted simulated portfoliovalues with line- and histogram plots
* Critique: Tool is simplified model and the most importand parameter volatility has to still be estimated
